Without empathy:

Nothing good happens!

You make assumptions e.g. assume the worst about other people / their motivations

Negative interactions - Relationships become strained, People become impatient & can lash out at each other

Difficult to trust others without understanding

It is more difficult to collaborate

You are disconnected and exist in your own little world
